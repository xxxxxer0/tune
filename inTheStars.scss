C                 Em7
Sick and tired of waiting
                 Am
So we learned to fly
            F
What a wild ride
C               Em7
Brave enough to make it
                  Am
And we're here to stay
                F
Yeah we found a way
C                                  Em7 
If you ever feel lost with nowhere to go
                                     Am
We can make a new world where nobody knows
                             F
Our place our space, calling home
                  C
We're all the way up up up
                 Em7
We'll never look down down down
             Am               F
Breaking the ceiling 'cause I believe the world is ours
                  C
We're all the way up up up
                 Em7
We'll never look down down down
                Am          F
I got a feeling that it was written in the stars

C~ Em7~ Am~ F~
